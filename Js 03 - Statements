* JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed.

JavaScript Programs
	A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by the computer.
	In a programming language, these program instructions are called statements.
	JavaScript is a programming language.
	JavaScript statements are separated by semicolons.

JavaScript Statements
	Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

JavaScript Values
	The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values: Fixed values and variable values.
	Fixed values are called literals. Variable values are called variables.

Numbers are written with or without decimals:
	10.50
	1001

Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:
	"John Doe"
	'John Doe'

JavaScript Variables
	In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
	JavaScript uses the var keyword to declare variables.
	An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6:
	var x;
	x = 6;

JavaScript Operators
JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables:
	var x = 5;
	var y = 6;

JavaScript is Case Sensitive
	All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive. 
	The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables.

	lastName = "Doe";
	lastname = "Peterson";
	
JavaScript and Camel Case
Historically, programmers have used three ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:

Underscore:
	first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.

Camel Case:
	FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.

<script>
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
var first-Name = "Hege";
var firstname = "Hege";
var last_name="Hege";
var MasterCard= "Hege";


console.log(z);
console.log(first-name);
console.log(firstname);
console.log(last_name);
console.log(MasterCard);
</script>
