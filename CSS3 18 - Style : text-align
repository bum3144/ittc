    <p>BACOLOD City – PDP-Laban presidential candidate and Davao Mayor Rodrigo Duterte is so used to death threats that another one no longer shakes him. 

“That has been going on even when I was mayor. I’m used to it actually,” Duterte told reporters during his meeting with Bacolod Bishop Vicente Navarra yesterday.

On Tuesday, rumors circulated that hired guns from Iloilo were out to assassinate him during his visit here yesterday.  Sources from within the Duterte camp were informed that some Iloilo-based drug lords hired the would-be killers.

Duterte declared during his meeting with Navarra that he is not afraid to die.

“The one thing that got me going all these years is I believe in destiny – the destiny that God has crafted for you. If there’s one passage I read almost everyday to remind me of God, it is ‘There’s a time to love, a time to be born, a time to die.’ If panahon mo na, panahon mo na (if it is your time, then it is your time),” he added.

Navarra assured Duterte of his prayers to guide him in his presidential bid, just like any candidate who would ask for his prayers.

He also told the mayor to follow the law if he gets elected president.

Duterte also visited his supporters at a convention center and held a dialog with the transport sector.</p>
